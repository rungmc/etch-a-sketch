# The Odin Project - Etch-a-Sketch

[Live project link.](https://rungmc.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

## Goal

To demonstrate a basic grasp of HTML/CSS/JS/DOM by building something vaguely resembling an Etch-a-Sketch.

## Skills Employed

Nothing too fancy here.  Used CSS Grid as the basis for the Etch-a-Sketch grid (because of course).  Populated it with divs in JS by using a double for loop to iterate over the X and Y axes.

Some FlexBox usage as well just to get things a *little bit* nicer looking.  I certainly could have lost a couple days to really spiffing up the CSS if I wanted to.  Might have been nice to include some sort of pop or glow effect on hover and really play around with transitions.
